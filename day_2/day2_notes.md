Edge Detection

- Noise smoothing
- Edge enhancement - Gradietn Estimation
- Edge localization(thresholding) - Classifcation.
  
  Reference algorithm - Canny edge detector
1. Gaussian Filtering
2. Gradient Magnitude
3. Non-maxima suppresion + threshholding
   
? Apperture problem: 

Corners - Steep math derivation.

Corners detection (Shi-Tomasi algorithm)
Corners correspond to points where the image gradient varies in atleast two 
directions. They can
be detected by computing and nalyzing the autocreation matrix

Lab Notes:

Edge: Canny and Self implemented
Corner Detection: shi_tomasi and implement myself?
